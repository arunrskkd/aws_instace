create instance
after that the key will be downloaded in extention key.pem
new folder aws
paste key in that.open terminal in that folder
then in aws dashboard instance connect
we will get the code to enter in terminal.
it will connect to instance
make sure that security group is added SSH then onli connect through terminal

then use putty to tranfer files.
tutorial is there when we connect

pscp -i C:\path\my-key-pair.ppk C:\path\Sample_file.txt ec2-user@[ipv6-address]:/home/ec2-user/Sample_file.txt


create instance --> connect --> connect with code seen  --> open another and install putty tools --> puttygen mykey.pem -o mykey.ppk  -->
pscp -r -i testMode.ppk server/* ubuntu@ec2-13-59-205-232.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/ubuntu/server/


need to create sequrity group ssh ,http ,https, and custom port 3000 to listen to in node app.

http.createserver().listen(3000)
